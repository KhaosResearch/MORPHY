/**
 * @brief Basal interface for Hidden Markov Models likelihood computation.
 *
 * HmmLikelihood classes compute the probability of data according to parameters (likelihood),
 * using the so-called forward recursion:
 *
 * - Initialisation: @f[ f_0({\cal A}_0), \ldots, f_0({\cal A}_n) @f] The initial frequencies, set to the equilibrium frequencies of the chain.
 * - Recursion (for i=1 to l, the length of the sequence data): @f[ f_i({\cal A}_y) = e_y(D_i) \sum_{x=1}^n f_{i-1}({\cal A}_x) \cdot p_{x,y} @f]
 * - Termination: @f[ \Pr(D) = \sum_{x=1}^n f_l({\cal A}_x) @f]
 * where @f$ {\cal A}_{1..n} @f$ denotes the hidden states of the alphabet, @f$ e_y(D_i) @f$ the
 * probability of the data at position i conditioned on hidden state y (emission probabilities)
 * and @f$ p_{x,y} @f$ is the probability of havving hidden state y at state i+1 knowing there
 * is hidden state x at position i (transition probabilities). These essential elements are given
 * respectively by the HmmEmissionProbabilities and HmmTransitionMatrix object associated to this
 * class. Both objects have to share the same HmmStateAlphabet instance, which describes all
 * allowed hidden states.
 *
 * The HmmLikelihood interface provides essentially two major methods:
 * - A method to retrieve the likelihood value (parameter estimation)
 * - Two methods to retrieve the posterio probabilities of each state using the forward and backward conditionnal likelihoods (posterior decoding).
