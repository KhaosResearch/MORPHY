Some examples for using PLL

PLL/

A simple example that loads a multiple sequence alignment from a PHYLIP file, a starting tree from
a newick file and a text file that describes partition and substitution model assignment. It then
evaluates the log likelihood of that tree, and performs several SPR moves to obtain a topology that
yields a better likelihood.
